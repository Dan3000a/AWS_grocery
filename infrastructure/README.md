üìå Updated Plan: Week-by-Week AWS Infrastructure Deployment (Including ALB & ASG)

‚úÖ Week 1: Core Infrastructure (VPC, EC2, RDS, Security Groups)

üîπ Goals
	‚Ä¢	Set up a networking environment (VPC, subnets, and route tables).
	‚Ä¢	Create security groups to define access rules.
	‚Ä¢	Deploy an EC2 instance in a private subnet.
	‚Ä¢	Deploy an RDS PostgreSQL database in a private subnet.

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
	‚Ä¢	Define a VPC CIDR block.
	‚Ä¢	Create two public subnets and two private subnets.
	‚Ä¢	Deploy an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public subnets.
	‚Ä¢	Set up route tables to control traffic.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Security Groups
	‚Ä¢	EC2 Security Group:
	‚Ä¢	Allow SSH (port 22) access only from a specific IP.
	‚Ä¢	Allow HTTP (port 80) access from anywhere.
	‚Ä¢	RDS Security Group:
	‚Ä¢	Allow PostgreSQL (port 5432) traffic only from EC2.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy an EC2 Web Server in a Private Subnet
	‚Ä¢	Launch an EC2 instance in a private subnet.
	‚Ä¢	Use user_data to install Docker & dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Attach a security group to control inbound/outbound access.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy an RDS PostgreSQL Database in a Private Subnet
	‚Ä¢	Create an RDS instance (PostgreSQL).
	‚Ä¢	Deploy in a private subnet (not publicly accessible).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure EC2 can connect to RDS.

‚úÖ Week 2: S3 & File Storage

üîπ Goals
	‚Ä¢	Deploy S3 storage for storing avatars/files.
	‚Ä¢	Modify the application to retrieve avatars from S3.
	‚Ä¢	Set up IAM permissions to allow EC2 to access S3.

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy an S3 Bucket
	‚Ä¢	Define an S3 bucket using Terraform.
	‚Ä¢	Configure access permissions (e.g., public/private access).
	‚Ä¢	Set up lifecycle policies if needed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Content to S3 via AWS CLI
	‚Ä¢	Use AWS CLI to upload avatars/images.
	‚Ä¢	Verify access and permissions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the Application to Use S3
	‚Ä¢	Change the app to pull avatars from S3 instead of local storage.
	‚Ä¢	Test the integration.

‚úÖ Week 3: IAM & Scaling

üîπ Goals
	‚Ä¢	Define IAM Roles & Policies for access control.
	‚Ä¢	Attach IAM roles to EC2, allowing it to access S3 & RDS.
	‚Ä¢	Prepare for Auto Scaling by ensuring permissions are set.

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create IAM Roles & Policies
	‚Ä¢	Define an IAM role for EC2 to access S3 & RDS.
	‚Ä¢	Attach necessary IAM policies.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Attach IAM Role to EC2
	‚Ä¢	Update Terraform to attach the IAM role to EC2.
	‚Ä¢	Verify access by running AWS CLI commands from the instance.

‚úÖ Week 4: Application Load Balancer & Auto Scaling

üîπ Goals
	‚Ä¢	Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle traffic.
	‚Ä¢	Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to dynamically adjust the number of instances.
	‚Ä¢	Implement health checks to replace unhealthy instances.

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
	‚Ä¢	Create an ALB with a listener on port 80.
	‚Ä¢	Attach a security group to control traffic.
	‚Ä¢	Register EC2 instances in a target group.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
	‚Ä¢	Define an ASG with a launch template.
	‚Ä¢	Configure min, max, and desired instance counts.
	‚Ä¢	Attach the ASG to the ALB target group.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Health Checks
	‚Ä¢	Ensure ALB removes unhealthy instances.
	‚Ä¢	Configure ASG to replace failed instances automatically.

üöÄ Let‚Äôs Start: Week 1

The first step is VPC, Security Groups, EC2, and RDS.

‚úÖ Shall we create the Terraform modules and files for this first, or do you want to work directly within the existing infrastructure folder? üöÄ
